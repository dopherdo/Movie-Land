# Movie Land


## A Movie Search Engine
This application allows users to type in keywords for a movie they would like to search for and, with the click of a button, will present a list of the best matching movies. Upon viewing the list, the user may also hover their mouse over each movie cover art to reveal the date the movie was created.

The backend utilized OMDb API to access a library of movies of all genres, including anime and TV series. I hope to include additional features to truly make this experience magical.

## Some Hardships
Using an API
* This was my first time using an API, and figuring out how to use keys and trying make sure the key is not exposed to the client-side code
* Interacting with the API and using their query language to get the right information
* After finishing the project, I had trouble getting the API to function properly on GitHub Pages

Designing the App
* OMDb API is relatively limited in its parameters, so I wanted to try my best to include everything that this API had to offer
* Adding smaller additions and finding ways to make the page pop more was quite challenging, but I was able to add an animation to the mouse over and some gradient over the title to make it stand out

## Future Features
* A Landing Page 
   * A better looking front page instead of a default "Batman" search
* Make the Art clickable hyperlink that will bring the user to a page with addtional information
   * Additional Short Plot with a dropdown that then displays the Long Plot
   * Still display the previous information but on a full page.
