# Movie Land


## The Movie Search Engine
This application allows users to type in keywords for a movie they would like to search for and, with the click of a button, will present a list of the best matching movies. Upon viewing the list, the user may also hover their mouse over each movie cover art to reveal the date the movie was created.


The backend utilized OMDb API to access a library of movies of all genres, including anime and TV series. I hope to include additional features to truly make this experience magical

## Future Features
* A Landing Page 
* Make the Art clickable hyperlink that will bring the user to a page with addtional information
* * Additional Short Plot with a dropdown that then displays the Long Plot
